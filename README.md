# Rio Kutty Activities Engine 🚀

Rio Kutty Activities Engine is an automated service designed to generate fun and educational activities for kids based on their favorite stories. Using advanced AI agents and structured workflows, it creates multiple types of engaging content like quizzes, art projects, and science experiments.

---

## 🌟 How It Works

The engine follows a simple but powerful process:

1.  **Request**: The service receives a request containing a `story_id` and the child's `age`.
2.  **Fetch**: It retrieves the full story text from the database (Firestore).
3.  **Generate**: Multiple AI "Agents" work in parallel to create different activities:
    -   **MCQ Agent**: Creates fun trivia questions.
    -   **Art Agent**: Suggests creative drawing or craft ideas.
    -   **Moral Agent**: Helps find the lesson or values in the story.
    -   **Science Agent**: Explains the "how" and "why" behind story events.
4.  **Validate**: A validator agent checks the content to ensure it's age-appropriate and high-quality.
5.  **Save**: The activities are saved back to the database for the app to display.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **Python**: The core programming language.
-   **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs.
-   **LangGraph**: A library for building stateful, multi-agent applications.
-   **Google Gemini AI**: The "brain" behind the content generation.
-   **Google Cloud Firestore**: The database for storing stories and activities.
-   **Pub/Sub**: Handles background messages for activity generation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
-   Python 3.11+
-   A Google Cloud project with GenAI and Firestore enabled.

### 2. Setup Environment
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
PROJECT_ID=your_gcp_project_id
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-exp
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python -m src.main
```
The server will start at `http://localhost:8080`.

## 📡 API Endpoints

-   `POST /generate-activities`: Directly triggers activity generation for a story.
-   `POST /pubsub-handler`: Listens for messages from Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
-   `GET /task-status/{story_id}`: Check the status of activity generation for a specific story.
-   `GET /health`: Simple health check.
